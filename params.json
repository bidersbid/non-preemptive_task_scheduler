These scheduling algorithms aim to provide optimal feasible schedules of task sets under various constraints. Despite such a radical increase in study of such algorithms, the schedulability analysis of non-preemptive tasks has received less attention in the real-time embedded research community.\r\n#\r\nThere are many benefits of using non-preemptive tasks over preemptive tasks on multiprocessor platform. This is primarily because in non-preemptive scheduling the task instance runs until its computation time on the same processor where as in preemptive scheduling task migration creates a lot of computational overheads and makes prediction difficult [ACR2011]. \r\n#\r\nIn this paper we prove by simulated implementation that despite EDF with idle task being an optimal method for uniprocessor platform [GMR1995], EDF is no longer optimal for multiprocessor platform. We show this by providing a feasible schedule by algorithm C described in [ACGR2010] and Algorithm D [ACR2013] for all task sets for which EDF failed to provide a feasible schedule. The tabulated result in Section III shows the feasibility of task sets by different scheduling methods. \r\n#\r\nThe aim of this paper is to show that although the scheduling problem is NP-complete, the Algorithms C and D were still able to find a feasible schedule for most single-instance, non-preemptive and independent task sets. In the next section we provide the implementation details for the simulation tool used for the analysis.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors:\r\n```\r\nŞtefan Andrei\r\nLamar University\r\nDepartment of Computer Science\r\nBeaumont, TX, USA\r\n```\r\n```\r\nAlbert M.K.
